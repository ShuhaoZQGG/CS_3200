4.  Provide a list of the names of all playlists containing tracks of the ‘Jazz’ genre or the ‘Classical’ genre.

1. Select tracks of the 'Jazz' or 'Classical' genre:

    GenreFilter = σ(Genre.Name = 'Jazz' ∨ Genre.Name = 'Classical')(Genre ⨝ Track)

2. Join the filtered tracks with the PlaylistTrack relation:

   PlaylistTrackJoin = GenreFilter ⨝ Track.TrackId = PlaylistTrack.TrackId

3. Project the names of playlists:

  Result = π(Playlist.Name)(PlaylistTrackJoin ⨝ PlaylistTrack.PlaylistId = Playlist.PlaylistId)


Result (in a single line):

Result = π(Playlist.Name)((σ(Genre.Name = 'Jazz' ∨ Genre.Name = 'Classical')(Genre ⨝ Track)) ⨝ PlaylistTrack.PlaylistId = Playlist.PlaylistId)
