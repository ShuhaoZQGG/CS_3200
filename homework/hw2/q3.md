3.  Are there any artists in the database with at least one track that does not appear on any playlist?  If so, give a list of the artist Names only. 

  1. Find all tracks that do not appear on any playlist:

     TracksNotInPlaylist = σ(Track.TrackId - PlaylistTrack.TrackId)
    
  2. Find the artists associated with the tracks that are not in any playlist:
      ArtistsWithTracksNotInPlaylist = TracksNotInPlaylist ⨝ (Track.ArtistId = TracksNotInPlaylist.ArtistId)

  3. Project the "Name" attribute to get a list of artist names:

     Result = π(ArtistsWithTracksNotInPlaylist.Name)

Result = π(Artist.Name)((σ(Track.ArtistId - PlaylistTrack.ArtistId) ⨝ (Track.ArtistId = Artist.ArtistId)) ⨝ Artist)
