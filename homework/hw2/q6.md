6. Give a list of the customerid and first & last name of all customers, the names (first and last) and emails of their support representatives, and the first and last name of each support representative’s manager. 

1. Obtain a list of customers, their first and last names, and customer IDs:

CustomerInfo = π(Customer.CustomerId, Customer.FirstName, Customer.LastName)(Customer)


2. Get the names and emails of the support representatives:

SupportRepInfo = π(Employee.FirstName, Employee.LastName, Employee.Email)(Employee ⨝ Employee.EmployeeId = Customer.SupportRepId)

3. Determine the manager for each support representative:

ManagerInfo = π(Employee.FirstName AS RepFirstName, Employee.LastName AS RepLastName, Manager.FirstName AS ManagerFirstName, Manager.LastName AS ManagerLastName)( (Employee AS Rep ⨝ Employee.ReportsTo = Manager.EmployeeId) )

4. Finally, combine the information from the previous steps to create the desired result:

Result = CustomerInfo ⨝ SupportRepInfo ⨝ ManagerInfo
